      <h2>About Frank</h2>
      <p>I'm a software engineer at Google working on the Search team. My work is focused on contextual awareness and user understanding. Previously I also worked on personalization in the <a href="https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/major-redesign-of-google-maps-is-unveiled" target="_new">new Google Maps</a>.</p>

      <p>Prior to this I founded <a href="https://lifehacker.com/zinepal-makes-you-the-editor-5335118" target="_new">Zinepal</a>, a simple web service to create custom eBooks and printable PDFs from web content. I also worked at two startups in the bioinformatics and medical device fields.</p>

      <p>I was born & raised in Germany before moving to Victoria, BC where I finished high school and attended the University of Victoria. After university I spent a few years in Vancouver, before moving to California, residing both in San Francisco and Los Angeles. I now live in Seattle.</p>
