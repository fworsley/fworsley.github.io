      <h2>A better way to detect Java WebStart <span class="date">May 22, 2009</span></h2>
        
      <p>So, just as I wrote that I wouldn't be posting much in future, I thought I would quickly post this little tidbit. There are various ways described online that you can use to detect if a client has Java WebStart installed. The problem is all of them require you to mix in VBScript for Internet Explorer and then use Javascript for the other browsers. There is a way you can support Internet Explorer and still use only Javascript. Check it out:</p>

      <pre>
      function jwsInstalled() {
        // For Internet Explorer.
        if (navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') > -1) {
          try {
            var jws = new ActiveXObject('JavaWebStart.isInstalled');
            return true;
          } catch (e) {
            return false;
          }
        }

        // Firefox is happy with "x-java-jnlp-file". For Chrome and Safari
        // this does not work, instead I just check for "x-java-vm".
        // If they have a recent JVM installed, then they usually also have
        // Java WebStart installed.
        return navigator.mimeTypes &&
               navigator.mimeTypes.length &&
               (navigator.mimeTypes['application/x-java-jnlp-file'] != null ||
                navigator.mimeTypes['application/x-java-vm'] != null);
      }</pre>
      
      <p>I use this to popup a little dialog and tell users to download a new JRE if Java WebStart is not installed. It works pretty well. And yes, it's 2009 and I'm still using Java WebStart ... although I do have a good reason for it. :-)</p>
