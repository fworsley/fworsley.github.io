      <h2>File Type Manager</h2>
      <p>This is one of the first real programs I ever wrote. It lets you manage Windows file types and shell extensions. Even though I wrote this in 2001 it still seems to work well in current versions of Windows, at least it still remains popular and is downloaded frequently.</p>
